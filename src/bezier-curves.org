* Pronunciation

  *Bez-ee-ay*


* Concepts

  Bezier Curves works on the concept of *Linear Interpolation*, which means that
  we have the lower and upper ends of some range, and we need to fit it
  additional values to the range. It's like filling the holes between the range
  using some values. The value which fills the holes is called the
  *interpolated* value.

  This would be a lot like string interpolation wherein we plug in the holes of
  the string using some known value.
